# `simple.js`
A small, little JS framework to make things simpler. Except, it just shortens some stuff.

## How to add `simple.js`
Include it from the raw data. You know how to do that. Then just use a `<script>` tag, and BAM! You now have simple.js! This method can't be used for JS files though... If you need `simple.js` for a JS file, copy the code from the file here, it's less than 1kb!
